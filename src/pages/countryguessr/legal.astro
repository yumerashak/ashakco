          <h2 class="h2">Privacy Policy</h2>
          <div class="meta">
            Applies to: “CountryGuessr” for iOS and Android, published by Ashak
            Studios.
          </div>

          <h3 class="h3">1) Summary</h3>
          <p>
            CountryGuessr is built to respect your privacy. We do not run player
            accounts and we do not collect or store personal data on Ashak
            Studios servers. App preferences and progress are stored locally on
            your device.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game displays in-game advertisements provided by Google AdMob
            after you have correctly identified a certain number of cities
            (currently 32). Before that milestone, no ads are shown. You may
            optionally unlock an ad-free experience through an in-app purchase
            or subscription, but you can continue playing with ads enabled if
            you prefer. Ad delivery and measurement are handled by Google; we do
            not operate our own ad servers.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">2) Data We Do <em>Not</em> Collect or Store</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              No player accounts, usernames, or passwords are managed by Ashak
              Studios.
            </li>
            <li>
              No direct collection of your name, email address, or phone number
              by Ashak Studios.
            </li>
            <li>No precise GPS location is stored by Ashak Studios.</li>
            <li>
              No separate analytics or telemetry SDKs are run by Ashak Studios
              beyond reporting provided by the app stores and by Google AdMob
              for advertising.
            </li>
            <li>
              No retention of device identifiers or IP addresses by Ashak
              Studios outside of what is made available in aggregate form by
              platform providers and AdMob.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, when ads are shown, Google AdMob (a third-party service
            operated by Google) may collect and process certain information such
            as device identifiers, IP address, app usage, and approximate
            location in order to provide and measure advertising. This
            information is processed under Google’s own privacy policies; Ashak
            Studios does not control how Google uses that data. For details,
            please review Google’s Privacy Policy and any in-app consent or ad
            settings offered by your device or platform.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">3) Local-Only App Data</h3>
          <p>
            The game keeps limited settings on-device (for example: language,
            sound, UI preferences, high scores, and country progress). Removing
            the app from your device removes these records.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">4) Payments (Ad-Free / Pro Access)</h3>
          <p>
            CountryGuessr is offered as a free download. After you have
            correctly identified a certain number of cities (currently 32), you
            may be offered an optional product (for example, a “Pro” or
            ad-free upgrade) that disables in-game advertising. Payments are
            processed by Apple’s App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android). We do
            not receive your full payment details and we do not run our own
            payment servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Purchasing the ad-free product is entirely optional — you can
            continue to play CountryGuessr with ads enabled instead of buying
            anything. Depending on your region and platform, this product may be
            offered as a one-time purchase or as a subscription; please refer to
            your store listing for pricing, duration, and renewal information.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">5) Children’s Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            If you are under the age required by local law to make purchases or
            provide consent, please use the game with a parent or guardian.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">6) Connectivity</h3>
          <p>
            The game can open offline. Ad delivery and purchase validation may
            require an internet connection; when offline, ad availability and
            purchase status may not refresh until connectivity is restored.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">7) Changes to This Policy</h3>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy as products or requirements
            change. If updated, the new version will replace this one and the
            “Effective Date” above will be revised.
          </p>

    <!-- TERMS OF SERVICE -->
    <section id="/terms" class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="card">
          <h2 class="h2">Terms of Service</h2>
          <div class="meta">Effective Date: {EFFECTIVE_DATE}</div>

          <h3 class="h3">1) About These Terms</h3>
          <p>
            These Terms govern your use of CountryGuessr for iOS and Android,
            published by Ashak Studios (“we,” “us”). By installing or using the
            game, you agree to these Terms.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">2) License</h3>
          <p>
            We grant you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
            revocable license to use the game on compatible devices for
            entertainment. You may not reverse engineer, redistribute, or
            commercially exploit the game.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">3) Advertising</h3>
          <p>
            CountryGuessr displays third-party advertisements provided by Google
            AdMob once you have reached a certain gameplay milestone (currently
            after you have correctly identified 32 cities). Before that
            milestone, no ads are shown. Ads help keep the game free to play.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may choose to continue playing with ads enabled or, if
            available, purchase an ad-free product (for example, “Pro” or an
            ad-free upgrade). If you do not purchase this product, ads will
            continue to appear as part of normal gameplay after the free
            threshold is reached.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">4) Purchases</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              <strong>Ad-free / Pro product:</strong> After you have correctly
              identified a certain number of cities (currently 32), you may be
              offered an optional product that disables in-game ads. Buying this
              product is not required to access the core gameplay; you can
              always continue using the app with ads enabled.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Type of product:</strong> Depending on platform and
              region, the ad-free option may be implemented as a one-time
              purchase or as a subscription that may auto-renew until you
              cancel. The exact pricing, duration, and renewal terms are shown
              in the store listing. There are no hidden subscriptions; any
              subscription product will be clearly labeled as such.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Platform processing:</strong> Payments are processed by
              Apple’s App Store or Google Play. Manage receipts, family
              sharing, refunds, and subscription management (if applicable)
              through your platform account and its policies.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3">5) Third-Party Services</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to platform billing (Apple App Store / Google Play),
            CountryGuessr uses Google AdMob to serve in-game advertisements
            after you reach the free-play threshold. Google AdMob is a
            third-party service operated by Google. Its collection and use of
            data are governed by Google’s own terms and privacy policy; we do
            not control how Google processes that data.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not operate our own ad or analytics servers. Any basic
            analytics or reporting we see comes from the app stores and from
            AdMob in aggregated form.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">6) Connectivity</h3>
          <p>
            Some features, including validating purchases and loading ads, may
            require internet access. If you are offline, purchase status or
            ad delivery may be unavailable or temporarily out of date until
            connectivity is restored.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">7) Warranties & Liability</h3>
          <p>
            The game is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest
            extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim warranties of
            merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
            non-infringement, and we limit liability to the maximum extent
            permitted by law.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">8) Changes to These Terms</h3>
          <p>
            We may revise these Terms when features or requirements change.
            Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated
            Terms.
          </p>
